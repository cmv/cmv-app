[![Read The Docs](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-1.3.4-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](http://docs.cmv.io/) [![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/Join Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/cmv/cmv-app?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge) [![Build Status](http://travis-ci.org/cmv/cmv-app.svg?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/cmv/cmv-app) 

## Introduction
[CMV](http://cmv.io/) is a community-supported open source mapping framework. CMV works with the [Esri JavaScript API](http://docs.cmv.io/en/latest/developers.arcgis.com/javascript/jsapi/), [ArcGIS Server](http://www.esri.com/software/arcgis/arcgisserver), [ArcGIS Online](https://arcgis.com/) and more.

## Make It Your Own!
This JavaScript web app can be easily configured or used as a boilerplate/starting point for basic viewers. It also demonstrates best practices for modular design and OOP via classes in JS using dojo's great [declare](http://dojotoolkit.org/reference-guide/1.9/dojo/_base/declare.html) system.
